# GraphQL

I have been looking for a solution for real time data synchronization on Android. For that I had a couple of options. 

Firebase Firestore & AWS AppSync

I started exploring AppSync and got to know that it is based on GraphQL which led me to further explore GraphQL itself.

I found it pretty interesting and can think of many use cases where teams should adapt GraphQL over RestAPI. This is more of a client first thinking.

Also came across this wonderful documentary of how GraphQL came into inception: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=783ccP__No8

And this very neat comparison of GraphQL and Rest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=broQmxQAMjM

Apollo which is a platform for building a data graph, a communication layer that seamlessly connects your application clients (such as React and iOS apps) to your back-end services. https://www.apollographql.com/docs/

And of course the official website: https://graphql.org/
